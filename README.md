# DSA in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms that I'm learning as part of my DSA course.

## About

This is a comprehensive collection of DSA problems and solutions organized by topics. The repository covers various fundamental concepts including arrays, strings, algorithms, recursion, mathematical problems, bit manipulation, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Purpose

To practice and build a strong foundation in DSA using Java for coding interviews and problem-solving.

## Note

Work in progress — more topics and problems will be added as I learn.
