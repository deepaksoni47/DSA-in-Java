- Subarray problems
- Two-pointer techniques

### 📁 **strings/** (8 files)
String manipulation problems including:
- Palindrome checks
- Anagram detection
- Longest substring problems
- String validation

### 📁 **algorithms/** (3 files)
Core algorithms including:
- Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort)
- Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

### 📁 **recursion/** (2 files)
Recursion and backtracking problems including:
- Factorial, Fibonacci
- Subset generation
- Permutations
- Tower of Hanoi

### 📁 **math/** (7 files)
Mathematical problems including:
- Number conversions (Binary ↔ Decimal)
- Prime numbers
- Power calculations
- Factorial

### 📁 **bit-manipulation/** (1 file)
Bit manipulation techniques and operations

### 📁 **basics/** (3 files)
Basic programming concepts:

## Purpose

To practice and build a strong foundation in DSA using Java for coding interviews and problem-solving.

## Note

Work in progress — more topics and problems will be added as I learn.
